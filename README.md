# Patient-grouped benchmarking of postoperative glioma segmentation pipelines

This repository contains the manuscript and reproducibility materials for
**Nested Patient-Grouped Benchmarking of 3D Deep-Learning Pipelines for
Multiclass Postoperative Glioma Segmentation on Longitudinal MRI**.

The study compares 3D U-Net, Residual 3D U-Net, 3D V-Net, and 3D U-Net++ under
a controlled Keras pipeline and evaluates nnU-Net v2 3D full resolution as a
practical whole-pipeline comparator. The analysis uses 594 eligible longitudinal
MRI examinations from 203 patients in the public MU-Glioma-Post collection.
All partitions are patient grouped, with an inner tuning partition for model
selection and a held-out outer fold for evaluation.

This is a technical internal-validation study. It is not a diagnostic-accuracy
study and does not establish clinical utility or external generalizability.

## Study design

The primary matrix consists of five model families evaluated across five frozen
outer folds using training seed 2026. Additional fold-1 runs with seeds 2027
and 2028 assess optimization sensitivity without increasing the independent
patient sample size. Checkpoint selection, learning-rate scheduling, and early
stopping use only the inner tuning partition. The outer fold is used only for
full-volume evaluation of the selected checkpoint.

The complete design and fixed run definitions are available in
[`protocol/PRESPECIFIED_ANALYSIS.md`](protocol/PRESPECIFIED_ANALYSIS.md) and
[`protocol/run_matrix_manifest.csv`](protocol/run_matrix_manifest.csv).

## Primary result

The prespecified primary target is the patient-level Dice coefficient for the
combined tumor-related region (labels 1–3). Each estimate contains one
out-of-fold result per patient and architecture.

| Model | Patients | Mean Dice | 95% bootstrap CI |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 3D U-Net | 203 | 0.774 | 0.748–0.799 |
| Residual 3D U-Net | 203 | 0.785 | 0.759–0.808 |
| 3D V-Net | 203 | 0.781 | 0.755–0.805 |
| 3D U-Net++ | 203 | 0.761 | 0.735–0.786 |
| nnU-Net v2 3D fullres | 203 | 0.879 | 0.856–0.900 |

nnU-Net changes multiple pipeline components and is therefore interpreted as a
whole-pipeline comparator, not as an architecture-only comparison. Full overlap,
surface, lesion-level, absent-reference, fold, seed, and efficiency results are
reported in the manuscript and under [`results/final_analysis/`](results/final_analysis/).

## Manuscript

- [PDF](manuscript/MU_Glioma_Research_Paper.pdf)
- [DOCX](manuscript/MU_Glioma_Research_Paper.docx)

The manuscript has not yet completed journal peer review. Numerical claims
should be interpreted within the limitations described in the paper.

## Dataset

The original MRI images and reference segmentations are not redistributed here.
They are available from The Cancer Imaging Archive:

- Collection: [MU-Glioma-Post](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/mu-glioma-post/)
- Dataset DOI: [10.7937/7K9K-3C83](https://doi.org/10.7937/7K9K-3C83)

The frozen patient-level split definitions used in this study are included in
[`protocol/splits/`](protocol/splits/).

## Reproducibility

The committed CSV, JSON, Excel, and figure files are sufficient to inspect the
reported numerical results without downloading the imaging dataset. To prepare
the analysis environment:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r environment/requirements-analysis.txt
python reproducibility/audit_execution_notebooks.py
```

The full analysis program reads the validated run archives from
`results/validated_zips/no1` through `results/validated_zips/no35`. Those large
archives contain checkpoints, logs, configurations, detailed metrics, and
full-volume predictions. They are retained by the authors but are not currently
distributed through this repository. Their filenames, sizes, and SHA-256 hashes
are recorded in [`results/validated_result_manifest.csv`](results/validated_result_manifest.csv)
and [`artifacts/validated_archive_checksums.sha256`](artifacts/validated_archive_checksums.sha256).

The exact training notebooks are included for method inspection and replication.
Running them requires a separately obtained copy of MU-Glioma-Post and a
compatible GPU environment. Platform-specific storage paths may need adaptation;
the patient partitions, random seeds, stopping rules, target definitions, and
evaluation rules should remain unchanged for a direct replication.
